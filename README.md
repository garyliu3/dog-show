## About

This is a super simple single-page web application built with ReactJS. The application is a "dog show" where the user is presented with the choice of two dogs and can pick one of them, giving the chosen dog a point and loading a new dog to replace the unchosen dog. Once a dog has been selected 4 times in a row, that dog is declared the winner, then a new round can be started.

This application uses a public API to load in random dog images. The API can be found [here](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
